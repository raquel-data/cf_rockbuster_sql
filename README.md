Rockbuster is a fictional movie rental company looking to grow into an online business model. Their dataset is analysed through SQL to answer business questions.
This is part of the Career Foundry project.

## Objectives
Rockbuster Stealth’s business intelligence (BI) department needs your help with the launch strategy for the new online video service. 
Your first task is to load all of Rockbuster’s data into a relational database management system (RDBMS). Then, you’ll use SQL to analyze the data and answer any
ad-hoc business questions that other departments may have.
